This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using various machine learning models and compares them over many different metrics. By analysing patient data, the system assists in early diagnosis and better medical decision-making.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and reliability.
- Visualizations for data insights and model results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
