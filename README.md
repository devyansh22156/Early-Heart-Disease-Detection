# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using various machine learning models. By analyzing patient data, the system assists in early diagnosis and better medical decision-making.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models for prediction.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and reliability.
- Visualizations for data insights and model results.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devyansh22156/HeartDiseaseDetect_using_ML_Models.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HeartDiseaseDetect_using_ML_Models
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Place your dataset file (CSV format) in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset contains the necessary features for prediction.

2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
   This script cleans and prepares the data for model training.

3. Train the machine learning models:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```
   This script trains multiple models and saves the best-performing one.

4. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input sample_input.csv
   ```
   Replace `sample_input.csv` with the path to your input file.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `models/`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and prediction.
